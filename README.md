# Chat with PDF using Gemini ðŸ’¬

This Streamlit app allows users to ask questions related to the content of uploaded PDF files and receive answers generated by Gemini, a generative AI model.

## Usage

1. **Ask a Question:**
   - Enter your question in the text input field.

2. **Upload PDF Files:**
   - Upload PDF files using the file uploader in the sidebar.

3. **Submit & Process:**
   - Click on the "Submit & Process" button to extract text from the uploaded PDF files and create an index for similarity search.

4. **Get Answers:**
   - The app will process your question and provide answers based on the content of the PDF files.

## How it Works

- The app uses the [PyPDF2](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/) library to extract text from PDF files.
- The extracted text is split into chunks using the [langchain](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/langchain) library.
- Embeddings for text chunks are generated using the Google Generative AI model.
- Text chunks are indexed using FAISS for efficient similarity search.
- Gemini's generative AI model is used for question answering.
